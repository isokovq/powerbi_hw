1. Power BI is a Microsoft business analytics tool that lets users visualize data and share insights across an organization. Power BI desktop, Power BI Service and Power BI Mobile
2. First: Sales performance tracking – visualize KPIs like revenue, conversion rates, and top-performing regions
Second: Financial reporting – monitor expenses, budgets vs. actuals, and cash flow trends
3. We can visit powerbi.nicrosoft.com and click download free and install or we can download it in Microsoft Store
4. We use Power BI desktop for ETL process report building and testing and it's local. Power BI Service is cloud-based and we use to publish , share and collaborate on reports
5. .pbix
6. Power Query is a tool which used for Extract, Transform and Load process, we can clean, shape, and make data consistent.
7. Better modelling and dataset handling, Way better and more interactive dashboards, Centralized and secure via the cloud
8. We cannot share or publish it in the cloud.
9. A report that has been uploaded from Power BI Desktop to the cloud (Service) for sharing, viewing, or collaboration.
10. It provides on-the-go access to dashboards and reports, with real-time alerts and optimized touch interfaces.
11. Power BI is cheaper, easier to learn for beginners, Seamless with Microsoft ecosystem, Great for small-medium data models, visuals are Solid, but slightly less customizable.
Tableau is Expensive especially at scale, Steeper learning curve, has broader integration with many platforms, handles large datasets more efficiently, 
visuals are more flexible and polished
12. 
Azure Synapse: direct querying for big data
Azure ML: run predictive models within reports
Azure Data Lake: as a data source
Azure AD: user authentication and security
13. Gateways are bridges between on-premises data sources and Power BI Service.
Used when your data is not in the cloud but you still want to refresh it in the Power BI Service.
14. Time Efficiency: Power BI significantly reduces the time spent on manual reporting by automating data refreshes and allowing for reusable, dynamic dashboards.
Cost-Effective Scalability: Compared to alternatives like Tableau or Qlik, Power BI offers a lower licensing cost, especially within Microsoft environments, making it ideal for scaling across departments.
Better Decision-Making: By providing near real-time insights, stakeholders can make faster, data-driven decisions, reducing missed opportunities and reactive firefighting.
Integration-Ready: It integrates seamlessly with Excel, SQL Server, SharePoint, Azure, and other tools we’re already using—reducing onboarding friction and speeding up deployment.
Security and Governance: With built-in Row-Level Security and Azure AD support, we ensure sensitive data stays protected without sacrificing accessibility for authorized users.
